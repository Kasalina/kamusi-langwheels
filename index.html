        <h2>What are Language Wheels?</h2>
        <p>
            A Language Wheel is a colorful graphic to easily identify a language, so you can select it on a website or
            telephone.
            Each Wheel is a circle divided into 6 segments, and each segment can be one of 9 colors - resulting in
            531,441
            possible
            unique combinations. Colors have been custom-selected for all languages spoken by more than one million
            people
            and
            all
            languages with an official status in any country. For other languages, colors were initially assigned at
            random;
            people
            associated with each language community are eagerly invited to propose better schemes based on
            locally-appropriate
            colors <b>through the end of 2017</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below is an example wheel for Swiss German:

        <h2>What problems do Language Wheels solve?</h2>

        <p>
            Choosing a language on a website or phone can be hard. If you want to read a site in German, do you choose
            "German",
            or
            "Deutsch", or "de", or a picture of the German flag? If you are in Switzerland, where the major languages
            are
            German,
            French, and Italian, you will certainly object to having your language indicated by the flag of Germany,
            France,
            or
            Italy! If you land on a site in another language, do you know the magic word in that language that will get
            you
            back
            to
            your own language - for example, how would you get to the German version of a site in Japanese? Not even
            English
            is
            easy
            - should it be identified by the flag of Britain where it was born or the American flag where it has the
            most
            native
            speakers, and what about the prevalence of English in Australia, Canada, or South Africa? What if a language
            has
            different variations, such as Canadian French versus the French of France?
        </p>
        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.migros.ch/de.html" target="_blank">Swiss site with 3 languages</a> is already tough.
            Choosing
            among 19 languages, such as <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/" target="_blank">WordReference.com,</a>
            leads
            to
            some
            very complicated menus. A list of 46 languages, like Global Voices <a href="https://globalvoices.org"
                                                                                  target="_blank">(visit
            them!)</a> gets really messy. And, as technology becomes ever more ubiquitous, a <a
                href="https://indigenoustweets.com" target="_blank">digital presence could emerge</a> for any of more
            than
            7000
            languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Language Wheels solve these problems by offering a consistent and unique visual identifier for each
            language,
            and
            even
            for each known language variety. Just as the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-France"
                                                            target="_blank">French</a>,
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-the-Netherlands" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, and <a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Russia" target="_blank">Russians</a> learn to identify
            and
            distinguish their national flags, people can quickly learn Wheels for the languages that interest them.
            Then,
            whenever
            they see their Wheel, they know they've found their language.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site makes it easy for web and app developers to download and install the Wheels they need, using
            vector
            graphics
            that scale to any size. Language selection menus with embedded Wheels are also available.
        </p>

        <h2>How are colors decided?</h2>
        <p>
            At Kamusi, we believe that all languages are equal, but in digital media <a
                href="https://www.quora.com/George-Orwell-author-said-All-animals-are-equal-but-some-animals-are-more-equal-than-others-What-does-that-mean"
                target="_blank">some are more equal than others</a>. We began by randomly generating colors for each
            language
            with an ISO 639-3 code, as well as identified sub-varieties. We tamed the randomness with visual heuristics,
            for
            example
            assigning the same color to two contiguous segments as often as possible, or alternatively having the same
            color
            in
            directly opposite segments.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reversed this egalitarian approach for languages with a large digital presence, any official legal
            status, or
            more
            than a million speakers. High numbers of people seek services in those languages, with the most-digitized
            languages
            being the most important to identify for the most people. Mega-languages like English, Chinese, Spanish, and
            Arabic
            should be identifiable at a glance. Below are the wheels for English, Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic,
            respectively:
        </p>

        <div style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
            <img src="eng.png" style="width: 24%">
            <img src="zho.png" style="width: 24%">
            <img src="spa.png" style="width: 24%">
            <img src="ara.png" style="width: 24%">
        </div>

        <p>
            When selecting colors for customization, we began by considering whether there was a close association with
            a
            national
            flag. However, flags were problematic, with at least 13 languages married to red, white, and blue! We
            tweaked
            the
            Wheels
            to use those colors in distinct patterns for English, French, Russian, and others. For some languages,
            though,
            we
            looked
            to other colors of significance to their speakers - for example, we ditched the red-white-blue Dutch flag in
            favor
            of
            the orange and white of their national football uniform.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the 11 official languages of South Africa, we started with variations on the colors of that country's
            flag.
            We
            reduced the possibility for confusion, though, by using the flags of neighboring countries for languages
            widely
            spoken
            elsewhere, such as the colors of Botswana's flag for the Setswana language. We selected the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Cusco" target="_blank">Flag of Cusco</a> as the basis for
            the
            vibrant Quechua Wheel, and made many similar judgements for several hundred languages.

            Guidelines for submitting a wheel:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use colors that have meaning locally.</li>
            <li>For a set of languages that are related, consider having a consistent scheme on one part of the Wheel,
                and
                varying
                the
                colors on the other part. Don't go overboard on consistency, however - for example, it would be
                impossible
                to
                distinguish the 800 languages of Papua New Guinea if they were all based on the black-white-red-orange
                of
                that
                country's
                flag.
            </li>
            <li>Arrange colors in memorable patterns, such as making one color repeat next to itself or across from
                itself.
            </li>
            <li>Check the "Similar Wheels" tab to make sure your scheme, or something too much like it, is not already
                being
                used.
            </li>
            <li>In the "Rationale" space, explain why the Wheel represents the language, in at most a few sentences.
            </li>

        </ul>


        <h2>Our Goal: An International Standard</h2>

        Wheels are a simple solution to a problem for any digital service that operates in more than one language. Until
        now,
        each developer has had to tackle the problem afresh - reinventing the wheel on every website, so to speak. Were
        the
        software industry to have a systematic way of representing languages graphically, a lot of hassle would be saved
        in
        supporting multilingual services. Meanwhile, consumers would benefit from a consistent experience that made it
        quick
        and
        easy to identify services in their own languages.

        After the Wheel color schemes have been finalized with the input of interested communities, we will prepare a
        proposal
        for the International Standards Organization to adopt these icons as a global standard. The next meeting of <a
            href="https://www.iso.org/committee/48104.html" target="_blank">ISO/TC37</a>, the technical committee
        responsible for approving terminology and other language and content resources, will occur in June 2018. Our
        hope is
        to
        have a proposal ready for that meeting, although this timeframe might be optimistic. And, if the graphics become
        a
        truly
        popular visual mechanism for referencing language names, perhaps they could become part of the UNICODE character
        set,
        like the emoji set that now makes all national flags easily accessible as standard characters across operating
        systems.

        <h2>Caveats and Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The languages available are those that have been assigned ISO 639-3 codes by <a
                    href="http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/default.asp" target="_blank">SIL</a> on behalf of the <a
                    href="https://www.iso.org" target="_blank">International Standards Organization</a>. In special
                cases,
                we have
                provisionally added a language that does not have an ISO code, but perfecting the list of the world's
                languages is
                outside of the scope of this project - please
                <a href="http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/submit_changes.asp"
                   target="_blank">submit change requests to SIL</a>
                using
                their
                formal procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most wheels point to a language writ large, without differentiating elements such as multiple writing
                systems or
                multiple orthographies for the same language. Please alert us if a language comes in many flavors, and
                we
                might be
                able to add a provisional additional wheel.
            </li>
            <li>
                The language names in our configuration tool are presented in as many languages as we have data for. <a
                    href="https://www.ethnologue.com/" target="_blank">Ethnologue</a> lists endonyms on each language's
                individual
                page, but we don't have the resources to scrape that data. If you can help us collect the local names
                for
                some chunk
                of languages, we will be thrilled to add them to our language selector tool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Because Language Wheels are based on color, they inherently fail to meet Web Content Accessibility
                Guidelines
                1.4.1 (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a>) for
                the
                color
                blind.
            </li>
        </ul>
